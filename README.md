Prototype of a peer-to-peer Tailgating marketplace written for my Senior Capstone Thesis.

**Demo video was created as a backup for a presentation, so theres no audio explaining the functionalities or what im doing**

UI is very basic and simple, as the focus was on the backend and Google Maps, and there was a limited amount of time.

Written in PHP. Uses MySQL database. Google Maps integration for searching properties, calculating distance, etc.
